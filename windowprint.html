        Materials:
        Water, cement and sand.
        Coarse aggregates except the size being 40 mm.
        Proportion:
        CC 1:2:4/1:1.5:3 (cement:sand:coarse aggregates by volume unless otherwise specified).
        Mixing:
        It is done on a clean, water tight, masonry platform or sheet iron tray of sufficient size.
        Coarse aggregates and sand are measured in boxes of size 30 cm x 30 cm x 38 cm, the volume being equal to 1.2
        cft i.e. volume of one bag (50 kg) of cement.
        All materials are dry. If moist sand is used, compensation is made for bulking.
        Mixing is done in a mixer and for small work hand mixing may be done.
        In hand mixing, 2/1.5 boxes of sand are mixed dry thoroughly with one bag of cement and then this mix of cement
        and sand is spread over 4/3 boxes of coarse aggregates as required and the mixed dry turning at least three
        times to have uniform mix.
        Water is then added slowly and gradually with water can while being mixed to the required quantity 25-30 litres
        per bag of cement to give a plastic mix or required workability and water cement ratio.
        The whole is mixed thoroughly turning at least three times to produce homogeneous mix.
        Alternately, coarse aggregates, sand and cement are put sequentially into concrete mixer in the above proportion
        as required and mixer run to mix materials dry and then water is added gradually 25-30 litres per bag of cement
        to have required water cement ratio.
        Mixing is continued to 1.5 -2 mins to get a plastic mix of uniform colour.
        Mixed concrete is then unloaded to masonry platform/ sheet iron tray.
        Slump:
        Regular slump test is carried out to control the dose of water to maintain the consistency.
        A slump of 4 – 5 cm is allowed for road work.

        Formwork:
        Centering and shuttering is provided as required as per standard specifications before laying concrete to
        confine to support or to keep concrete in position.
        Inner surface of shuttering is oiled to prevent sticking of concrete.
        The base and formwork over which concrete is to be laid is sprinkled with water before laying concrete.
        Forms need not be removed before 14 days, but side forms may be removed after 3 days of concreting.
        It should be removed with care without disturbing/damaging concrete.
        Laying:
        Concrete is gently laid in layers not more than 15 cm and compacted by pinning with rods and tamping with wooden
        tampers or with mechanical vibrators till a dense concrete is obtained.
        Over-vibration leading to separation of coarse aggregates is to be avoided.
        Proper compaction ensures absence of honeycomb on concrete surface after removal of formwork.
        If laying is suspended for unavoidable reasons or for next day’s work, the end is sloped at 300 and made rough
        for further joining.
        The sloped portion is roughened, cleaned, watered and a grout of cement slurry is applied before fresh concrete
        is laid.
        The same procedure is applied for laying subsequent upper layers.
        Curing:
        After 2 hours of laying, concrete is to be kept damp by covering with wet gunny bags or moist sand for 24 hrs
        and then cured by flooding water by making 7.5 cm high mud wall or by covering with wet sand for 14 days.
        Special water proof paper may be used to prevent evaporation of water.
